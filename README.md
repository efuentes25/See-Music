# See-Music

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with one other team member: 
We used the p5 javascript library to build a music visualizar. The user is able to pick between curtain songs that were provided in the program with their key board keys. Once they were able to choose which song they wanted, the song would play and show a music visualizar that will respond with the music that they chose.
If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open th einex.html file in a web browser.
